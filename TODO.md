Ideas for name: City++. Command Prompt General. 
A console command strategy game where everything is abstract and makes no sense! 

Add exploring as an option. Exploring should uncover percentage of an abstract map. The more it's been explored, the slower should exploration be. 
If you add more explorers, it gets quick again.
